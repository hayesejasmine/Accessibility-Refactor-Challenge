# Accessibility-Refactor-Challenge
Module 1 Challenge

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria 

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## The HTML Code Contains

```
Semantic HTML elements have been added to eliminate repetition and clearly define the structure of the webpage.

The HTML elements follow a logical structure, ensuring that the webpage makes sense and is easy to follow.

Alt attributes have been added to describe the images within the code.

The heading attributes fall in a sequential order, clarifying the hierarchy of the content on the page. The headings which follow the H1 element take the largest size and portray the highest importance. The headings which follow the H3 element remain larger than the normal text, but show less importance than the H1 element, as the size is slightly smaller.

The title element has been updated to portray a clear and descriptive title for the code.

Classes were created to simplify the code and eliminate unnecessary repetition.
